# Introduction
This repository publishs the source codes used in the paper "Topological Measurement of Deep Neural Networks Using Persistent Homology." It includes four source codes. 
* makeModelMNIST.ipynb
* makeModelCIFAR10.ipynb
* makeSimplex.ipynb
* drawDiagram.ipynb

### makeModelMNIST.ipynb, makeModelCIFAR10.ipynb
These source codes make traind models on the MNIST and CIFAR10 data sets. The models are stored in the "models" directory.

### makeSimplex.ipynb
This source codes constructs simplexes on trained models stored in "models" directory. The results are stored in "simplexes" directory.

# Introduction
This repository publishs the source codes used in the paper "Topological Measurement of Deep Neural Networks Using Persistent Homology." It includes four Python notebooks. 
* makeModelMNIST.ipynb
* makeModelCIFAR10.ipynb
* makeSimplex.ipynb
* drawDiagram.ipynb

### makeModelMNIST.ipynb, makeModelCIFAR10.ipynb
These notebooks make traind models on the MNIST and CIFAR10 data sets. 
The models are stored in the "models" directory.

### makeSimplex.ipynb
This notebook constructs simplexes on trained models stored in "models" directory. 
The results are stored in "simplexes" directory.

### drawDiagram.ipynb
This notebook draws persistent homology diagrams based on the files generated by the notebook "makeSimplex.ipynb."

# Usage
The notebooks are developed for the execution in Google Colaboratory. 
They mounts gdrive in their first cells, comment them out if unnecessary.

### Paramenters in makeModelMNIST.ipynb and makeModelCIFAR10.ipynb
They have four parameters for their model training.
* class_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
* firstLayerSize = 300
* secondLayerSize = 100
* outputNeuron = 10

"class_list" limits the input class of the data sets.
For example, class_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] limits the input from class 0 to 4.
"firstLayerSize", "secondLayerSize", and "outputNeuron" specifies the number of neurons in the training models.
